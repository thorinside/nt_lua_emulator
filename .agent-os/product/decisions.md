## 2025-09-05: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Establish the Disting NT LUA Emulator as a mature development tool requiring careful architectural maintenance rather than aggressive refactoring.

### Context

The codebase is described as "vibe coded" with 30+ modules in a complex interdependent architecture. The application is fully functional with all core features implemented and working.

### Rationale

- Preserve working functionality over architectural purity
- Maintain development velocity without breaking existing workflows
- Acknowledge the organic growth pattern that led to current success

## 2025-09-05: LÖVE2D Framework Choice

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Continue using LÖVE2D 11.3+ as the primary application framework with no plans for migration to other GUI frameworks.

### Context

LÖVE2D provides immediate execution, cross-platform compatibility, and strong Lua integration. The framework aligns with the target audience's preference for lightweight, accessible tools.

### Rationale

- **Zero-build philosophy**: Direct execution without compilation steps
- **Cross-platform support**: macOS, Linux, Windows compatibility
- **Lua native**: Perfect match for emulating Lua-based hardware
- **Community familiarity**: Target users already understand Lua ecosystem
- **Rapid prototyping**: Enables quick iteration during development

## 2025-09-05: No Testing Framework

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted (with future review)
**Category:** Development Process
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, QA Lead

### Decision

Continue without automated testing framework, relying on manual testing and hardware comparison validation.

### Context

The project currently has no unit tests, integration tests, or automated QA processes. All validation occurs through manual testing and comparison with physical hardware.

### Rationale

- **Complexity vs. benefit**: Testing GUI interactions and real-time signal processing is complex
- **Hardware validation**: Manual comparison with physical NT module provides ground truth
- **Resource allocation**: Development effort focused on features over test infrastructure
- **Interactive nature**: Much of the value comes from human interaction and visual feedback

**Future Review**: Reconsider for Phase 2 roadmap when adding advanced debugging features.

## 2025-09-05: Modular Architecture Preservation

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Maintain the current 30+ module architecture without major structural changes, treating it as a working system requiring careful modification.

### Context

The architecture evolved organically ("vibe coded") but has proven effective for separation of concerns and feature development. Each major subsystem is properly encapsulated.

### Rationale

- **Functional success**: Current architecture supports all required features
- **Clear boundaries**: Each module has well-defined responsibilities
- **Development velocity**: Team is productive within current structure  
- **Risk mitigation**: Major refactoring could introduce bugs without clear benefits

## 2025-09-05: State Persistence Strategy

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** User Experience
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, UX Lead

### Decision

Use JSON files (config.json, state.json) for all application state persistence with automatic saving on changes and exit.

### Context

Users need their I/O mappings, window positions, and preferences to persist between sessions. The application targets power users who expect professional tool behavior.

### Rationale

- **Human readable**: JSON allows manual editing and debugging
- **Version control friendly**: Text-based files work well with git
- **Cross-platform**: JSON parsing available on all target platforms
- **Immediate feedback**: Automatic saving prevents data loss
- **Debugging support**: Easy to inspect and modify state files

## 2025-09-05: OSC Integration Design

**ID:** DEC-006
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** External Integration
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Implement OSC messaging to 127.0.0.1:8000 with `/ch/[channel_number]` format and Ctrl-O toggle control.

### Context

Users need to integrate emulator output with external applications like DAWs, Max/MSP, and other audio software. OSC is the standard protocol for real-time parameter control in audio applications.

### Rationale

- **Industry standard**: OSC is widely supported in audio software ecosystem
- **Low latency**: UDP protocol provides minimal network overhead
- **Simple format**: Channel-based addressing is intuitive for modular users
- **User control**: Toggle allows easy enable/disable for different workflows
- **Local default**: 127.0.0.1:8000 works out-of-the-box for most use cases

## 2025-09-05: Script Sandboxing Approach

**ID:** DEC-007
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Security & Stability
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Security Review

### Decision

Use Lua's protected call (pcall) mechanism with limited global access to sandbox user scripts without preventing emulator crashes.

### Context

User scripts run arbitrary Lua code that could crash the emulator, access sensitive system resources, or interfere with emulator functionality.

### Rationale

- **Crash protection**: pcall prevents script errors from terminating emulator
- **Development focus**: Allows rapid iteration without fear of breaking main application
- **Limited overhead**: Minimal performance impact compared to full virtualization
- **Lua native**: Works within existing language constraints
- **Debugging friendly**: Error messages still provide useful information

## 2025-09-05: Hot Reload Implementation

**ID:** DEC-008
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Developer Experience
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, UX Lead

### Decision

Implement automatic script reloading on file system changes without requiring manual refresh or restart.

### Context

Script development requires rapid iteration. Traditional workflows force developers to manually reload or restart after every change, breaking creative flow.

### Rationale

- **Immediate feedback**: Changes visible instantly after saving
- **Creative flow**: Eliminates context switching between editor and emulator  
- **Professional experience**: Matches expectations from modern development tools
- **Reduced friction**: Lower barrier to experimentation and iteration
- **State preservation**: Application state maintains continuity across reloads

## 2025-09-05: Dual UI Mode Strategy

**ID:** DEC-009  
**Status:** Under Review
**Category:** User Interface
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, UX Lead

### Decision

Plan to remove space-bar Control/Parameter mode switching in favor of unified interface.

### Context

Current implementation requires users to toggle between Control mode (buttons/encoders) and Parameter mode (knobs/sliders) using space bar. User feedback suggests this adds complexity without clear benefit.

### Rationale

- **Cognitive load**: Single interface reduces mental model complexity
- **Feature completeness**: All controls should be accessible simultaneously  
- **User feedback**: Community requests for simplified workflow
- **Development efficiency**: Maintaining two UI modes adds code complexity

**Implementation**: Planned for Phase 1 (API Modernization) roadmap.
